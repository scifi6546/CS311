##  According to “On Following Rules”, what rules should we never break?
    Follow every rule you don't understand.
    Only break rules you fully understand and have good reason to break.
	
## According to “On Following Rules”, how should we deal with a rule we do not understand?
    Follow it

## According to “On Following Rules”, when can we break a rule?
    When you understand it
## Give an example of a rule, as the term is used in “On Following Rules”.
    Goto considered harmful.
## Give an example of a rule that you might correctly break, according to the standards in “On Following Rules”, and explain circumstances in which you would break it.
    Goto may be used when performace is extremly important or low level coding. For example I am writing a game on a old console. I may have to use GOTO
## What is an expression?
    Something that has a value
## True or false? When a type conversion is applied to a variable, it may alter the value of the variable.
   false because data is only translated to things that have more detail, int to float, not float to int. (Actually that may be considered loosing info)
## What is an Lvalue? What is an Rvalue?
    rvalue: something that lives in an expression only
    lvalue: something that outlives an expression.

##    Classify expressions in some C++ code as Lvalue or Rvalue.
    Example. Consider the following C++ code.

              vector<int> data(10);
              const int m = 3;
              data[0] = m;
              data[m] = 37+data[0];

    Classify each of the following as Lvalue or Rvalue.
        data: lvalue
        data[0]: lvalue
        m: lvalue
        data[m]: lvalue
        37: rvalue
        37+data[0]: rvalue

## Which C++ expressions are simultaneously both Lvalues and Rvalues? Which C++ expressions are neither Lvalues nor Rvalues?
   NONE! either lvalue or rvalue not both
## Name and briefly explain each of the four C++ parameter-passing methods we discussed.
by value:
```void foo(bar bars);```
by refrence:
```void foo(bar& bars);```
by refrence to const:
```void foo(const bar& bars);```
by rvalue refrence:
```void foo(bar&& bars);```

## Under normal circumstances, which parameter-passing method is used to pass an int?
```void foo(int bar);```
## Under normal circumstances, which parameter-passing method is used to pass a vector<int>?
```void foo(const std::vector<int>& bar);```
## Under normal circumstances, which parameter-passing method is used to pass an iterator?
    ??
## What is a special circumstance in which we would use pass by value to pass something of a type that we would not normally pass by value?
   when I want a copy that I can change
## When do we return by reference / reference-to-const?
   WHen there is a large variable that takes a long time to copy
## What does overloading mean?
   1 name can call 2 different methods
## What do we mean by the arity of an operator?
   Number of arguments that an operator takes
## In C++, we can implement an overloaded operator using either a global function or a member function. How does this choice affect the parameters the function takes?
    member function does not allow type conversion
    Global allows type conversion
## We generally want to implement an operator using a member function, when we have no good reason not it. Give two good reasons not to, which may apply to some operators.
    1. We can not modify the object
    2. We need type conversion

operator=
## What is a default constructor?

## What is an assignment operator?
operator=
## When we talk about a copy constructor or a copy assignment operator, what do we mean by “copy”?
data in class is copied
## When we talk about a move constructor or a move assignment operator, what do we mean by “move”?
data is never moved, owenrship is transferred

## Explain the differences between a copy constructor and a move constructor: how they take their parameters, and what they (probably) do.
	move: foo(foo&& bar);
	copy foo(foo& bar);

## In what circumstances does C++ automatically write a class’s default constructor?
    When everything has a ctor already
## Your instructor refers to certain functions as “invisible”. What does he mean?
    The fctn is never explicitly called
## Suppose we want a C++ class to have no copy operations. How can we eliminate these operations?
    foo(foo& bar)=delete;

SOmething that is assumed to always be true
## Explain preconditions and postconditions. What do we use these for?

## What is a class invariant?
something is true in a class
## Finish the following.

A class invariant is a postcondition of every public member function, except dctors
## Given a description of a function, write reasonable pre- and postconditions for the function.
    Given a description of a class, write reasonable class invariants.
## Your instructor says that talking about “the constructor” (as opposed to “a constructor”) usually indicates that there is a misunderstanding. What is this misunderstanding?
   There are several ctors
## Your instructor says that the first goal, when writing code, should be to get it to compile. Why is this? What important advantage do we lose when we work on code for an extended time without being able to compile it?
  The code can be tested when it can compile
## Some people are in the habit of writing a whole bunch of code, saying, “I’m done,” and then trying to compile it for the first time. Your instructor replies, “No, you’re not done; you just started.” Explain.
  the code has never been tested 
    What is wrong with writing (say) a bracket operator for an array class, that takes an int parameter? What would be a better choice for the parameter type?

    the resource can be used by others usually means that it is usuably by the os. 
	For example free()

    Give an example of a C++ Standard Library class or class template that uses RAII.
    Explain the use of the C++ explicit keyword.

    Explain foward, bidirectional, and random-access iterators. How do they differ?
    Give an example of a range-based for-loop.
    What is the connection between a range-based for-loop and the begin and end member functions that most container classes have?
    For each of the following STL algorithms, explain what it does and how it is called: std::copy, std::equal, std::sort, std::fill.
    State the Rule of Zero.
    What do we mean by an error condition?
    True or false: When an error condition occurs in a function, the function must inform the caller.
    There are three—and only three—ways to deal with the possibility of an error condition in a function. What are they? Hint: “throwing an exception” is not one of them.
    What does DRY stand for? What does it mean?
    What does it mean when two modules are tightly coupled? Is this a good thing or a bad thing?
    What does it mean for a module to be cohesive? Is this a good thing or a bad thing?
    What is an exception?
    What happens if a C++ exception is thrown, but it is never caught?
    What C++ keyword is used when throwing an exception?
    What C++ syntax do we use to catch every exception, and then rethrow the same exception when we have done what we need to? Be precise & detailed.
    For each statement below, indicate whether you instructor says it is true or false. If true, then explain why he says it is true.
        In C++, constructors should not throw.
        In C++, destructors should not throw.
    Some people dislike exceptions, because using them means that programmers are required to do lots of work. Let us take it as given that (1) exceptions do make lots of work for programmers, and (2) we do not want programmers to be overworked. Nonetheless, your instructor claims that this is a bad reason to dislike exceptions. Why does he say that?

    How do we mark the end of a Linked List?
    An empty Linked List has no nodes. How do we represent an empty Linked List.
    A Linked List holds essentially the same kind of data as an array. Why, then, would we ever want to use a Linked List? We could simply use (smart) arrays for everything, right?
    What is the difference between a Singly Linked List and a Doubly Linked List?

    What happens if a recursive function never reaches its base case?
    Explain direct vs. indirect recursion.
    Briefly explain how the Binary Search algorithm works.
    In the context of Binary Search, what is a pivot?

    Given a list of size to search in, at most how many list items does Binary Search need to examine (roughly)?
    Briefly explain how the Sequential Search algorithm works.
    Why is Sequential Search sometimes preferable to Binary Search?
    A quote mentioned during the lecture: “As machines become more powerful, the efficiency of algorithms grows more important, not less.” How can this possibly be true?
    Binary Search requires a sorted list, and it is only efficient if the list is random-access. Sequential Search, on the other hand, works for just about any dataset. Why, then, do we generally prefer Binary Search?

        Suppose some algorithm is log-linear time. Express this using big- notation.
    Compare efficiency categories, indicating which is faster.
    Examples
        Which is faster, quadratic time or logarithmic time?
    Algorithms faster than linear time are rare. This is because there is a specific thing that such an algorithm cannot do. What is it?
    In our list of efficiency categories, there were two categories that were faster than linear time. Name these two categories.
    Roughly speaking, how slow can an algorithm be and still be considered scalable? Answer using our standard terminology for efficiency categories.

## Describe one of the commonly used optimizations for Quicksort. What behavior does the algorithm have without the optimization, and how does the optimization change this?
    Different partition scheme. This causes the algo to skip over the data less.

        How is this possible?
	- knows info about data
